A personalized AI-powered mental health companion that offers empathetic, intelligent, and accessible conversations to help users manage stress, anxiety, and promote emotional well-being.
This project focuses on the design and development of an AI-powered mental health 
chatbot aimed at providing accessible, empathetic, and real-time support for 
individuals facing emotional distress, stress, anxiety, or related psychological 
challenges. With the rising global concern over mental well-being and limited access 
to timely professional help, this chatbot serves as a first line of emotional assistance. 
Built using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies, 
the chatbot simulates human-like conversations that are sensitive, confidential, and 
user-centric. It is available 24/7 and offers an intuitive interface that encourages users 
to open up in a non-judgmental digital space. 
Key features include sentiment-aware response generation, secure user 
authentication using JWT, and a conversational UI designed with React for ease of 
use. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB 
handling user data securely. The chatbot is capable of understanding context, 
detecting user sentiment, and adapting its responses accordingly, creating a 
personalized and emotionally intelligent interaction. 
Importantly, this tool is not intended to replace professional mental health 
practitioners, but rather to complement existing systems by offering early-stage 
support and encouraging users to seek further help if needed. It also offers emotional 
journaling, check-in reminders, and resources for meditation and stress relief. 
This project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being, and SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities) by promoting 
mental health accessibility and reducing disparities in care. It demonstrates how 
technology can be ethically and effectively used to support human well-being. By 
combining AI capabilities with a compassionate design philosophy, this chatbot has 
the potential to make a meaningful impact on mental health awareness and support, 
especially among youth, students, and underserved populations.
